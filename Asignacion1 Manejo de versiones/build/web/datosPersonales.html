            <P> Holaa!!</p>
            
        <p> My name is Michelle Aglae Naffate Campoy I am currently studying software engineering and I am in the sixth semester. <br />  
       My favorite hobbies are:<br />
reading books and manga, listening to music, playing the piano, sometimes playing classic video games, painting and drawing landscapes.
I consider that one of my skills is to be a good leader analyzing and understanding the work style of the members in order to assign them a task according to their abilities and thus arrive at an excellent job. I am also good at reading and understanding texts this is very useful when programming.
In the future I hope to be able to finish my studies and be able to put them into practice in a recognized company and continue expanding and sharing my knowledge or perhaps forming my own company.
